## What is a ***Un***conference?

An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. The term "unconference" has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference, such as high fees, sponsored presentations, and top-down organization.

Unconferences are designed to both encourage and require active participant involvement by suggesting topics, scheduling sessions, and even leading discussions. 

For more on unConferences, please check out [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference#Styles_of_facilitation).

### Want to organize a Spryker Unconference yourself?
Cool! Thank you so much for putting in the time and effort to organize a Spryker event and bringing the community together on a regular basis. **You are awesome!**

We already have a general [Code of Conduct](https://commercequest.space/discussion/27749/community-guidelines-code-of-conduct) for our community. You can refer to this document as organizers of the Unconference.

To align ourselves, have a consistent image, and make sure your event gets the attention it deserves, we do have some tips & guidelines for you. If you have any questions/remarks about these, please let us know or submit a change!

## How to start:
- Read through this handy guide to getting started ðŸ˜‰
- Get in touch with your Spryker contact person or [fill out this contact form](https://form.asana.com/?k=Ry92V_78RAs3Zxde5AJtJw&d=21158181759478) and we'll help you take the next steps from there!

## What we expect from you as an organizer:
### General organization
- Spryker community events should be open to anyone that wants to join that has a ligitemate interest in Spryker, even if that is a competitor;
- Dates should not overlap with other Spryker community meetings in the same region. You can check the [CommerceQuest events overview](https://commercequest.space/events/category) and coordinate dates with surrounding community event organizers;
- If you are organizing this as a commercial company, some promotion in exchange for your effort is ok (and are of course great for employee branding in general). But these community meetings should ***not*** turn into commercial pitching, selling or recruiting events;
- You run the show: as a local organizer you are the first point of contact for speakers and attendees, not Spryker or the Spryker Community Team.

### Content/ Topics
- Spryker not you as an organizer are in the lead of the ideas, topics or the program of a local User Group. It is all done by the participants! However, that doesn't mean you can't have an overall event team or suggest topics during the Unconference kickoff session.
- Most of the content will come from participants themselves, but you can decide to have one or two short keynotes or workshops (related to the theme) to kick off the event.

### Participant rules
For an unConferenceence to be succesful ALL participants need to be mindful and supportive of a few basic rules:

1. Everyone is a participant;
2. All participants must actively engage in activities;
3. Everyone has a role to play in making the event successful;
4. There are a variety of session types and formats in which to participate.
Find the one that fits well with your style but be willing to explore other
options. You will be a participant in many different ways throughout this
event!
5. Maintaining the schedule and being mindful of time is a sign of respect for participants and their contributions, so we all need to be thoughtful
timekeepers.

As everyone in the unConference is a participant, participation in different session events may be different. There are several different modes of participation:
* **Lead Participant**: people leading the discussion (also called presenters);
* **Facilitators**: people who have been selected as session facilitators, moderators, and discussants;
* **Participants**: people in the room who will be joining in the discussion.

### Announcing the event 
- Contact community@spryker.com to add your event details to the [CommerceQuest events overview](https://commercequest.space/events/category). Your event post should include information about your event, including the date/time, agenda, theme, if there is a food & drink offer, the location, and any other relevant information.
- In your text, be as clear as possible about your target audience to manage expectations. For example: You don't want business managers showing up unknowingly to very technical developer sessions.

### During the event
- We would like to provide you with some Spryker-themed gear to set up during the event (ex. signs, a pull-up banner, or merch). Request it in time and we will deliver them to you ðŸ˜Š.
- Try to get people to already submit ideas for future community events (locations and topics).
- Say thanks to the venue hosts and sponsors (when applicable).
- Have FUN!

### After the event
- Use CommerceQuest to thank all the participants and ask them to contribute new topics/locations for new meetings.
- We highly recommend creating a blog (text or video) summary of the event and publish that on CommerceQuest for further promotion. These articles can of course contain links to or images from the location hosts and/or sponsors of the event.

## When following these guidelines, you can expect the following from the Spryker Community team:
- Promotion of your community event through our website and social channels.
- Access to our network of the best speakers from other events.
- We'll send over someone from Spryker to join the event.
- We'll send you some Spryker merch to hand out to the participants of the event.
