 ## About The Project

### Challenge
We're creating an number of evergreen "community docs":
- Hackathon/meetup blueprint
- Guides on how to contribute to Open Platform (Spryker/Propel/Oryx)
- Community Ranks (individual/company)
- (historical) hackathon projects/logs.
- etc …

These docs don't really fit the CQ forum format, neither do they fit in other Spryker web properties
(OR we can't integrate these in short term because those other properties are currently being reworked).

So we needed a (at minimum temporary) solution.

### Solution

- Create a new community website/landingpage that can host our (non-software) community docs.
- Free & easy to host (e.g. Github)
- Easy to contribute to for Devs and Non-Devs (Markdown)
- Fast (SSG/ Flat file)
- CommerceQuest brand
- Some decent template available to get up-and running quickly

So at our Turbine x Spryker hackathon in May 2024, this repo was created :)

 ### Built With

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [ScrewFast Monolingual template](https://github.com/mearashadowfax/ScrewFast/tree/monolingual-site)
